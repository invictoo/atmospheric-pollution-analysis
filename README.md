# Atmospheric Pollution Analysis ‚Äì Graz, Austria

**Case Study Project (2024)**  
As part of a university case study, we analyzed atmospheric pollution data in Graz, Austria, focusing on **NO‚ÇÇ** and **PM10** levels to understand the impact of human activity.

---

##  Project Objective
- Investigate which pollutant (NO‚ÇÇ or PM10) is more influenced by human activity.  
- Test the impact of including/excluding human-activity predictors (e.g., day type).  
- Apply machine learning models to predict pollutant levels and evaluate performance.

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Selection**  
  - Linear Regression diagnostics  
  - VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) check for multicollinearity  

- **Machine Learning Models**  
  - Random Forest Regressor (with GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning)  
  - Linear Regression baseline models  

- **Evaluation Metrics**  
  - R¬≤ score (train/test sets)  
  - Feature importance analysis  

---

##  Key Findings
- **NO‚ÇÇ predictions** achieved R¬≤ up to **0.82 (test set)**.  
- Human activity (‚Äúday type‚Äù) significantly improves NO‚ÇÇ prediction accuracy.  
- PM10 showed weaker correlation with human activity ‚Üí more dependent on natural factors.  
- Observed variance patterns changed after the first COVID-19 lockdown.
